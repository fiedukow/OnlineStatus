# OnlineStatus
Ugly and basic network monitoring tool in python with hardcoded windows desktop path and interface in polish

# Usage.

I suggest deployment for Polish speaking user on windows using:

`$ pyinstaller --onefile --windowed online.py`

Then you just leave the exe running for as long as you want to monitor the network, admin rights required.
You may want to extend hardcoded hosts list.

# Disclaimer

This is not safe, robust nor refined tool, no guarantees that it will not create a backdoor to your PC or burn your house.
